# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Classification
Dicoding's final assignment on Machine Learning Course

This project is  a final assignment on Dicoding's Machine Learning course (https://www.dicoding.com).  We are given hundreds of hand photos that are labelled with rock, paper, and scissor. Then, we should create a model that can predict whether a hand is posing a rock, paper, or scissor. The model that I have made, consistently shows good accuracy (80% or above). Eventhough it still has a problem when predicting real hand images.

Here, I posted the source code in .ipynb file :point_down: :point_down: :point_down:
